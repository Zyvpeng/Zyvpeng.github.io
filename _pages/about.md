Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a senior undergraduate student at Xidian University, preparing to pursue my graduate studies at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I have a keen interest in both server-side development and artificial intelligence algorithms. During my undergraduate years, my research primarily focused on AIGC and video understanding. In graduate school, I plan to work on research related to VLM. As of now, I‚Äôm still a rookie in the research field. If you‚Äôre interested in my work or research direction, feel free to reach out to me!

[**Project**](https://flow-audio-synth.github.io/Flow-Audio-Synth/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- combining the powerful CLIP image encoder with an optical flow algorithm, focusing on both the rich static semantics and dynamic features of videos to facilitate the generation of higher fidelity, fine-grained audio
- Evaluation results show that Flow-Audio-Synth outperforms state-ofthe-art(SOTA) methods in terms of both correlation and fidelity.
